A neural network exercise

This repository contains two very similar jupyter notebooks - a first attempt at a neural network model and then an optimized version. It also contains a Report markdown file which summarizes the analysis done.

All code was written by me, although the Google Colab AI kept trying to help me complete lines that it thought I was trying to write, and I occasionally took its "advice" whether I intended to or not (for example, I didn't set up a for loop quite right, and it suggested a correction when the code failed - the suggestion worked).
